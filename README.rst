The Slack Emoji Uploader
========================

This is a command-line tool for uploading custom emoji to Slack.

This functionality is not available through the Slack API, so instead,
this tool manually builds the HTTP requests that would be made if you
were to upload the emoji by hand through the Slack web UI.

Installation
------------

To install this script, first checkout the latest sources:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/feadoor/slack-emoji-uploader.git

Then install the script using `pip`:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -e .

Or `pipsi`:

.. code-block:: console

Python 2.7 and Python 3.4+ are supported, and you may even find it works
on other versions too!
